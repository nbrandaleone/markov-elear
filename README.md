# markov-elear

This program creates text using Markov chains.
It is based upon the blog "https://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1",
by Carin Meier.

I did not complete the entire tutorial, although
I did finish the core.  What remains is to run
the Markov process on additional sample text files
and to do some artistic "tweaking". Finally, the
output is directed towards a twitter feed.  All very
interesting, but I was most interested in the Markov process.
